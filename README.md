# **Name Search with LIKE & ILIKE Operator.**
This SQL query is designed to search for names in a table using the LIKE and ILIKE operators. The query selects the first_name column from the students table and filters the result set based on the pattern provided.

The first part of the query uses the LIKE operator to perform a case-sensitive search for first names that start with the letters 'Th'. The second part of the query uses the ILIKE operator to perform a case-insensitive search for first names that start with the letters 'de'.

Users can modify the query to search for different patterns by changing the letters in the pattern matching expression. They can also choose between LIKE and ILIKE operators based on their specific use case.
